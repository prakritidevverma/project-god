# Project GOD

This project is my dream project, the idea is can I create an operating system that can act like a human but does't have a will power. However, smart enough that nobody can figure it out who they are talking or interacting with. A human or a machine.

Current Goal of this project is to create a small assistant operating system. My other project RESEARCHKERNEL will later connect wiht this project, researchkernel.org manage and provides open search paper. That information can be used for imporving decisions.

I have also developed falvour of linux using open source kernel, If I can make changes at the base level of the opertion system, then this will be an AI operation system. 

I think, I want to create a god and I want to be his creator.
